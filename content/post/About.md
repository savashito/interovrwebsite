**Intero VR**&nbsp; helps athletes achieve their potential by reducing stress, fear, and anxiety through visualization. Our VR training apps connect people in order to create a sense of community and support. We have introduced the first headset designed specifically for athletes. It is form-fitting, ventilated, lightweight, and has a larger field of view. This headset can be used with athletic training machines as well as for personal visualization without a machine. Ultimately, we aim to introduce people to the incredible applications of VR.
